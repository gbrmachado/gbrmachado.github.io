title: HackerRank's Project Euler 
---

I've been solving some Project Euler's problems in my spare time for the last couple of months. If you don't know what the Project Euler is:

: Project Euler is a project with a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer projects. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.

They have almost 200 problems there, some of them are quite easy, and others are really challenging.

Firstly I was practicing in the [http://projecteuler.net](official Project Euler' website). After some days I found a different version of these problems at HackerRank.

It has the same problems, but they take the complexity of the algorithm into account, which makes everything even funnier. 

I created a [https://github.com/gbrmachado/Project-Euler](github repository) with some answers for the problems.

In general, I think that Project Euler is a great way to improve your mathematical mind, or to train your mind to organize some thoughts in order to solve a problem, however, in terms of algorithms it's not the better thing.

I've solved almost 20 exercises so far(ok, it's not too much) and almost all of them could be solved without too much knowledge about algorithms or data structures. I used a lot of dynamic programming though, but I didn't use anything about graphs, for example.

Hopefully some challenger problems will use more algorithms or data structures, but even if they don't use them, it'll be fun to keep hacking with these problems.
