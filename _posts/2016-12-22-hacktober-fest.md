title: HacktoberFest
---

In October of 2015 I was moving back to Brazil when I heard about the HacktoberFest. It's an amazing initiative from Github and Digital Ocean to encourage people to contribute to Open Source projects. Basically they give a great t-shirt to anyone who contribute to any open source project with at least 4 pull request at github. What a great initiative, isn't?

As I couldn't contribute in 2015, I've decided that I definetely should make it.

I contributed to several open source projects, with both documentation and coding and at the end of October they send me an email asking my address to deliver the t-shirt.

The t-shirt arrived this week. Check it out the t-shirt(and the awesome stickies)

It's really an amazing project and I'm looking forward to the next Hacktober Fest

Thanks Digital Ocean and GitHub.
